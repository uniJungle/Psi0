    """Construct a freeze-target 36-D action for end-of-chunk supervision padding.

    Use as the target when padding training samples that overshoot the recorded
    episode end: the policy should learn to output this kind of action so that
    when AMO consumes it, the robot stays still at its end pose.

    Recipe: keep all *absolute* targets (joint qpos, waist, base height,
    target_yaw); zero the *relative*/discrete loco signals (vx, vy, turning_flag).

        kept:  [0:14] hand_qpos, [14:28] arm_qpos, [28:31] waist_rpy,
               [31] base_height, [35] target_yaw
        zeroed:[32] vx, [33] vy, [34] turning_flag

    Note: target_yaw [35] stays at the last commanded *world-frame* heading.
    For most end-of-task states the robot is already tracking that heading,
    so dyaw ≈ 0 and AMO holds. If the episode ended mid-turn the residual
    dyaw will still drive a small rotation; that's a separate question
    (would need current robot yaw, not available at supervision-target time).
